# 🌌 Asteria – Your Stellar Productivity System

**Asteria** is a productivity methodology that leverages AI and powerful productivity tools to create your own **personal solar system of knowledge**—helping you manage projects, tasks, research, and insights effortlessly.

Instead of manually navigating through scattered tools, Asteria guides you to orchestrate everything seamlessly through Anthropic's Claude AI, powered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Think of Claude as your central **productivity star**, intelligently connected to productivity planets—**Notion**, **Airtable**, **Qdrant**, and **Brave Search**.

✨ **With Asteria, your daily workflow becomes smoother, smarter, and brighter.**

## 🚀 Core Concept: Your Productivity Solar System

Picture your productivity as a **personal solar system**, with each tool orbiting the central star—Claude:

- ☀️ **Claude Desktop** *(Your Star)*  
  Acts as the central intelligence and interaction point, providing guidance and orchestrating other tools seamlessly via the MCP framework.

- 🌍 **Notion** *(Document Planet)*  
  Stores polished documents, notes, and structured knowledge accessible anytime and anywhere.

- 🪐 **Airtable** *(Data Planet)*  
  Manages tasks, projects, and structured data—keeping things orderly and actionable.

- 🌠 **Qdrant** *(Memory Comet)*  
  Provides long-term semantic memory—storing and retrieving insights and context from past experiences.

- 🌌 **Brave Search** *(Discovery Satellite)*  
  Provides real-time web search capabilities—enabling up-to-date research and insights.

Together, these components create a beautifully balanced productivity system, each tool complementing the other and revolving harmoniously around your central AI star—Claude.

## 🌠 How Does it Work? (High-Level)

```mermaid
graph TD
    user["User (You)"] -->|"Natural Chat"| claude["Claude AI (Desktop + MCP)"]
    claude -->|"MCP Integration"| notion["Notion (Docs & Notes)"]
    claude -->|"MCP Integration"| airtable["Airtable (Tasks & Data)"]
    claude -->|"MCP Integration"| qdrant["Qdrant (Semantic Memory)"]
    claude -->|"MCP Integration"| brave["Brave Search (Web Discovery)"]
```

In practice:

- You chat naturally with Claude, asking for help or making requests.
- Claude intelligently calls on each tool as needed through MCP integrations.
- Each tool provides specific assistance—writing docs, managing tasks, storing insights, or fetching information.
- Claude synthesizes all inputs, presenting coherent responses or taking actions for you seamlessly.

**📝 Example Scenario:** _"Summarize the status of the Apollo project this week."_

```mermaid
graph TD
    user["User"] -->|"Summarize Apollo status"| claude["Claude"]
    claude -->|"Fetch tasks"| airtable["Airtable"]
    airtable -->|"Tasks data"| claude
    claude -->|"Get notes"| notion["Notion"]
    notion -->|"Notes content"| claude
    claude -->|"Get insights"| qdrant["Qdrant"]
    qdrant -->|"Memory insights"| claude
    claude -->|"Save summary"| notion
    notion -->|"Confirms update"| claude
    claude -->|"Weekly summary"| user
```

This illustrates how smoothly Claude coordinates your tools—giving you precise insights instantly.

## 🌠 Getting Started (macOS Setup)

**Prerequisites**:
- Install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai).
- Ensure Node.js (16+) is installed ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)).

**Set Up Integrations**:
- **Notion**: [Create integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration).
- **Airtable**: [Generate personal access token](https://airtable.com/api).
- **Qdrant Cloud**: [Create a free instance](https://cloud.qdrant.io).
- **Brave Search**: [Get a Brave API Key](https://brave.com/search-api).

**Configure Claude Desktop** (use `claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notion": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@suekou/mcp-notion-server"],
      "env": { "NOTION_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN" }
    },
    "airtable": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "airtable-mcp-server"],
      "env": { "AIRTABLE_API_KEY": "YOUR_TOKEN" }
    },
    "qdrant": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mcpservers/ragdocs"],
      "env": {
        "QDRANT_URL": "YOUR_URL",
        "QDRANT_API_KEY": "YOUR_KEY",
        "COLLECTION_NAME": "asteria_memories"
      }
    },
    "brave-search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search"],
      "env": { "BRAVE_API_KEY": "YOUR_KEY" }
    }
  }
}
```

*(Replace placeholders with your actual API keys.)*

Restart Claude Desktop and test integrations with simple commands (e.g., "create a test Notion page" or "list Airtable tasks") to confirm setup.
