# 🌌 Asteria – Your Stellar Productivity System

**Asteria** is a productivity methodology that seeks to create the perfect **personal knowledge system**—helping you manage projects, tasks, research, and insights effortlessly through the power of AI and integrated productivity tools.

The vision is to create a seamless workflow where complex tasks become simpler through intelligent orchestration across your productivity toolkit.

## 🚀 Core Philosophy: The Ideal Productivity System

Asteria envisions productivity as three essential components working in harmony:

- 🧠 **AI Orchestrator**  
  An intelligent central hub with MCP capabilities to coordinate actions across tools and services.

- 🔍 **DeepSearch Capability**  
  - **External**: Powerful web search integration for real-time information gathering
  - **Internal**: Deep context-aware searching across your knowledge tools (Notion, Linear, etc.)

- 📊 **Systems of Record**  
  The best-in-class productivity tools for specific domains (Todoist, Notion, Linear, Attio)

Together, these components would create an unparalleled productivity system—but as our research shows, the perfect combination remains elusive.

## 📋 Research Findings (April 10, 2025)

We've evaluated several AI platforms as potential orchestrators, but none yet meets all our requirements:

### Claude
- 🟠 Requires paid subscription (rate-limited)
- 🔴 No external DeepSearch functionality
- 🔴 No internal DeepSearch functionality
- 🟢 MCP easy to install and functional
- 🟡 Partially mobile accessible
- 🟢 High-performance AI

### Cursor
- 🟠 Requires paid subscription (rate-limited)
- 🔴 No external DeepSearch functionality
- 🔴 No internal DeepSearch functionality
- 🟡 MCP harder to install
- 🔴 Not mobile accessible
- 🟢 High-performance AI

### OpenAI
- 🟠 Requires paid subscription (rate-limited)
- 🟢 External DeepSearch functionality
- 🔴 No internal DeepSearch functionality
- 🟠 MCP not available yet (coming soon)
- 🟡 Partially mobile accessible
- 🟢 High-performance AI

### Notion AI
- 🟠 Requires paid subscription (rate-limited)
- 🟢 Internal DeepSearch functionality
- 🔴 No external DeepSearch functionality
- 🔴 MCP not available
- 🟢 Mobile accessible
- 🔴 AI quality insufficient

**Current Status**: We're still searching for the ideal solution that combines all three essential components effectively.

    user["User (You)"] -->|"Natural Chat"| orchestrator["AI Orchestrator (with MCP)"]
    orchestrator -->|"Integration"| systems["Systems of Record"]

```

In this ideal system:

- You communicate naturally with the AI orchestrator
- The AI intelligently coordinates across your productivity tools
- DeepSearch capabilities provide comprehensive context from both internal systems and the web
- All inputs are synthesized into coherent, actionable insights

## ✨ Why "Asteria"?

In Greek mythology, **Asteria** was the goddess of shooting stars and nighttime prophecy. Just as stars once guided explorers across the seas, **Asteria** represents our quest to navigate the complex universe of productivity tools and AI capabilities—bringing clarity, organization, and efficiency to our digital lives.
