# üåå Asteria ‚Äì Your Stellar Productivity System

**Asteria** is a productivity methodology that seeks to create the perfect **personal knowledge system**‚Äîhelping you manage projects, tasks, research, and insights effortlessly through the power of AI and integrated productivity tools.

The vision is to create a seamless workflow where complex tasks become simpler through intelligent orchestration across your productivity toolkit.

## üöÄ Core Philosophy: The Ideal Productivity System

Asteria envisions productivity as three essential components working in harmony:

- üß† **AI Orchestrator**  
  An intelligent central hub with MCP capabilities to coordinate actions across tools and services.

- üîç **DeepSearch Capability**  
  - **External**: Powerful web search integration for real-time information gathering
  - **Internal**: Deep context-aware searching across your knowledge tools (Notion, Linear, etc.)

- üìä **Systems of Record**  
  The best-in-class productivity tools for specific domains (Todoist, Notion, Linear, Attio)

Together, these components would create an unparalleled productivity system‚Äîbut as our research shows, the perfect combination remains elusive.

## üìã Research Findings (April 10, 2025)

We've evaluated several AI platforms as potential orchestrators, but none yet meets all our requirements:

### Claude
- üü† Requires paid subscription (rate-limited)
- üî¥ No external DeepSearch functionality
- üî¥ No internal DeepSearch functionality
- üü¢ MCP easy to install and functional
- üü° Partially mobile accessible
- üü¢ High-performance AI

### Cursor
- üü† Requires paid subscription (rate-limited)
- üî¥ No external DeepSearch functionality
- üî¥ No internal DeepSearch functionality
- üü° MCP harder to install
- üî¥ Not mobile accessible
- üü¢ High-performance AI

### OpenAI
- üü† Requires paid subscription (rate-limited)
- üü¢ External DeepSearch functionality
- üî¥ No internal DeepSearch functionality
- üü† MCP not available yet (coming soon)
- üü° Partially mobile accessible
- üü¢ High-performance AI

### Notion AI
- üü† Requires paid subscription (rate-limited)
- üü¢ Internal DeepSearch functionality
- üî¥ No external DeepSearch functionality
- üî¥ MCP not available
- üü¢ Mobile accessible
- üî¥ AI quality insufficient

**Current Status**: We're still searching for the ideal solution that combines all three essential components effectively.

```

In this ideal system:

- You communicate naturally with the AI orchestrator
- The AI intelligently coordinates across your productivity tools
- DeepSearch capabilities provide comprehensive context from both internal systems and the web
- DeepSearch can directly store valuable insights and discoveries into your systems of record
- All inputs are synthesized into coherent, actionable insights

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Philosophy: Specialized Over All-in-One

A fundamental principle of Asteria is the belief in **specialized, task-specific tools** rather than all-in-one solutions. While platforms like Notion offer impressive versatility, they often compromise on depth and specialized functionality.

### Why Specialized Tools Win

- **Purpose-Built Excellence**: Tools like Linear are designed specifically for engineering workflows, providing deeper capabilities than generalized solutions.
- **Clearer Data Structures**: Specialized tools maintain well-defined schemas that are easier to query and integrate with AI systems.
- **Better API Integrations**: Purpose-built tools typically offer more comprehensive API access to their specialized features.
- **Optimized UX**: Specialized interfaces are tailored to specific workflows, increasing efficiency and reducing friction.

### AI Orchestration Benefits

This best-of-breed approach particularly shines with AI orchestration:

- **Clearer Data Mapping**: Well-defined data sources make it easier for the AI to understand context and relationships.
- **More Predictable Queries**: Specialized tools provide consistent data structures for more reliable AI interactions.
- **Domain-Specific Actions**: The AI can leverage specialized capabilities unique to each tool.

Rather than forcing all workflows into a single system like Notion, Asteria embraces the natural diversity of specialized tools while using AI to eliminate the context-switching friction typically associated with a multi-tool approach.
